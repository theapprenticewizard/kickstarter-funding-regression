3. determine which fields are categorical features or numeric fields
4. impute then scale numerical values
5. set dummies for categorical data
6. recombine numeric and categorical data
7. apply PCA algorithm to increase efficiency and reduce over-fitting
8. re-split datasets into test and training data
9. run algorithm of choice (linear regression to start)
10. benchmark results
